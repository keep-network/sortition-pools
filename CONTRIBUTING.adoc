= Keep Contribution Guide

ðŸŽ‰ Thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰ Contributions are welcome from
anyone, and even the smallest of fixes is appreciated!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Keep and its packages.
These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to
propose changes to this document in a pull request.

== Getting started

1. Fork
   https://github.com/keep-network/sortition-pools[`keep-network/sortition-pools`]
2. Clone your fork
3. Follow the
   link:README.md#Setup[installation & build steps] in the README.
4. Set up the <<Development Tooling>>.
5. Open a PR against the `main` branch and describe the change you are intending
   to undertake in the PR description.

Before marking the PR as ready for review, make sure:

* It passes the linter checks (`npm run lint` and `npm run lint:fix`).
* It passes the https://github.com/keep-network/sortition-pools/actions[continuous
  integration tests].
* Your changes have sufficient test coverage (e.g regression tests have
  been added for bug fixes, unit tests for new features).

== Development Tooling

Commits
https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-commit-signature-verification[must
be signed].

=== Continuous Integration

Keep uses https://github.com/keep-network/sortition-pools/actions[Github
Actions] for continuous integration. All jobs must be green to merge a PR.

=== Pre-commit

Pre-commit is a tool to install hooks that check code before commits are made.
It can be helpful to install this, to automatically run linter checks and avoid
pushing code that will not be accepted. Follow the
https://pre-commit.com/[installation instructions here], and then run
`pre-commit install` to install the hooks.

=== Linting

Linters and formatters for Solidity, JavaScript, and Go code are set up and run
automatically as part of pre-commit hooks. These are checked again in CI builds
to ensure they have been run and are passing.

To run the linters and formatters manually, use the following commands:
* `npm run lint` - checks files against linting rules.
* `npm run lint:fix` - checks files against linting rules and fixes any
  issues that can be fixed automatically.

If you want to change a rule, or add a custom rule, to the JavaScript or
Solidity linting, please propose these changes to our
https://github.com/keep-network/solium-config-keep[solium-config-keep], 
https://github.com/keep-network/eslint-config-keep[eslint-config-keep], or 
https://github.com/keep-network/prettier-config-keep[prettier-config-keep]
packages. All other packages have them as a dependency.
