/// @title Sortition Pool
/// @notice A logarithmic data structure used to store the pool of eligible
/// operators weighted by their stakes. It allows to select a group of operators
/// based on the provided pseudo-random seed.
/// @dev Keeping pool up to date cannot be done eagerly as proliferation of
/// privileged customers could be used to perform DOS attacks by increasing the
/// cost of such updates. When a sortition pool prospectively selects an
/// operator, the selected operatorâ€™s eligibility status and weight needs to be
/// checked and, if necessary, updated in the sortition pool. If the changes
/// would be detrimental to the operator, the operator selection is performed
/// again with the updated input to ensure correctness.
