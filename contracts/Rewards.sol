/// @title Rewards
/// @notice Rewards are allocated proportionally to operators
/// present in the pool at payout based on their weight in the pool.
///
/// To facilitate this, we use a global accumulator value
/// to track the total rewards one unit of weight would've earned
/// since the creation of the pool.
///
/// Whenever a reward is paid, the accumulator is increased
/// by the size of the reward divided by the total weight
/// of all eligible operators in the pool.
///
/// Each operator has an individual accumulator value,
/// set to equal the global accumulator when the operator joins the pool.
/// This accumulator reflects the amount of rewards
/// that have already been accounted for with that operator.
///
/// Whenever an operator's weight in the pool changes,
/// we can update the amount of rewards the operator has earned
/// by subtracting the operator's accumulator from the global accumulator.
/// This gives us the amount of rewards one unit of weight has earned
/// since the last time the operator's rewards have been updated.
/// Then we multiply that by the operator's previous (pre-change) weight
/// to determine how much rewards in total the operator has earned,
/// and add this to the operator's earned rewards.
/// Finally, we set the operator's accumulator to the global accumulator value.
