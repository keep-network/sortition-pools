/// @title Fully Backed Sortition Pool
/// @notice A logarithmic data structure
/// used to store the pool of eligible operators weighted by their stakes.
/// It allows to select a group of operators
/// based on the provided pseudo-random seed and bonding requirements.
/// The fully backed pool uses bonds instead of stakes
/// to determine the eligibility and weight of operators.
/// When operators are selected,
/// the pool updates their weight to reflect their lower available bonds.
/// @dev Keeping pool up to date cannot be done eagerly
/// as proliferation of privileged customers could be used
/// to perform DOS attacks by increasing the cost of such updates.
/// When a sortition pool prospectively selects an operator,
/// the selected operatorâ€™s eligibility status and weight needs to be checked
/// and, if necessary, updated in the sortition pool.
/// If the changes would be detrimental to the operator,
/// the operator selection is performed again with the updated input
/// to ensure correctness.
/// The pool should specify a reasonable minimum bondable value for operators
/// trying to join the pool, to prevent griefing the selection.
